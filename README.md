### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raj. CEO and Chief Engineer at [Silicon Witchery](https://www.siliconwitchery.com)

I focus on embedded hardware and firmware for FPGAs, ARM microcontrollers, and RF systems.

At Silicon Witchery, we're building really tiny wireless modules. Though, we also work with a lot of really cool research projects, including scientific instrumentation, and medical systems.

I have a huge passion for STEM and teaching, and in my free time, I'm helping to build the first community owned radio astronomy lab in Stockholm. 

If you're ever in town, feel free to drop by for a [fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_culture#Sweden), and I'll tell you all about it!
