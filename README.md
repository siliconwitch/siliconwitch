### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raj. Principal at [Silicon Witchery](https://www.siliconwitchery.com) in Sweden

I'm an Embedded Systems architect by trade, specializing in low power processors, sensing and RF. These days I primarily focus on our core product line, as well as managing the day-to-day operations of the business.

We are building an ever expanding line of wirelessly connected computers, along with Agentic AI platforms designed to let businesses quickly and easily query sensors, and drive robotic systems with as little friction as possible.

We're based in Stockholm, so if you're ever in town, let's get together for [fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_culture#Sweden), and I'll tell you all about it!
